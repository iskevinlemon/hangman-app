# Hangman with Dart
Mini hangman console game I made using Dart.

  <li>The choice of words that will be used for every round of the game will most likely be different</li>
  <li>All choices of the words are in <code>fruit.txt</code></li>
  <li>The program will read the <code>fruit.txt</code> and choose a random word</li>
  <li>Player have 5 attempts before the game over</li>
</ul>
